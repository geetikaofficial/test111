Ques 6 :

   		 bacon =22
        bacon+1
Output is : 23

Ques 7:

'spam'+'spamspam'
Output is : 'spamspamspam'

'spam'*3
Output is : 'spamspamspam'

The output of the two expression is same .

Ques 8: 

some rules to declare varaible:
1. the first letter of the variable must be a character or underscore_.
2. the first letter of the variable name never be a digit.
and,According both of the rules: 
eggs is a valid variable name becuase it starts with a character not with the special character or the digit.
and 100 is not a valid variable name because it starts with a digit and variable name never starts with a digit.

Example: 

1. eggs="cock"
			 print(eggs)
Output is: cock
    
2. 100="cock"
			  
error : cannot assign  to literal


Ques 10: 

first we write this line of code in the jupyter notebook . 

'i have eaten'+ 99 +'burritos'
 
Type error : can only concatenate str(not "int) to str

Ques 2:
		
String  = String is used to reperesent text and the text or charcters must be enclosed in single and double quotes.in string we can also insert space ,numbers etc.
ex 1: 'geetika'(single quotes string)
    "geetika"(double quotes string)
ex 2 :
str1 =("geetika")
print(str)
      
str2=("i am pursuing my Msc")
print(str2)
 
Variable: Variable are the containers to store data values.we first assign a value to it.

example: 
x=5
y="john"
print(x)
print(y)

Rules:
* Variable name must start with a letter or with underscore.
* Variable name never start with a number.
* Variable name is case-sensitive.

Ques 3:
		Three data types:
     	* list
		* set
		* dictionary

1.) List= list are used to store multiple value in a single variable.

example1: l=["geet","ranga","geetika",23,411]
 we can also add list into a list
ex2: l1=['geet','ranga','geetika',21,212,["happy","lucky"]]
 Also access list elements by index 
ex 3: l[0]
output is : 'geet'

 Also reverse a string: l[::-1]
Output is : [["happy","lucky"],212,21,'geetika','ranga','geet']

2.) Set : Set are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set is unordered,unchangable and unindexed.
Set do not allow duplicate values.
set={"geet","ranga","geetika"}
print(set)

find also the length of the set

len(set)
Output is :  3

Also loop through the set items by using a for loop:
for i in set:
	print(x)

	
3.) Dictionary: It can store key:value pairs.A dictionary is a collection which is ordered,changable.

dic1={"name":"geet","age":21,"year":2021}
dic1["name"]
Output : 'geet'
Looping is also possible  :  

for i in dic1:
	  print(i)#print only the key values
 Output is :name
			 age
			 year

Ques 4:
 
Expression : Expression is made up of operators and operands.Expression is a combination of operands and operators which produce some other value.

ex= a+b #expession & + is an operator.

lets take a look of example of expression:

1.) a*b ,a>b,a>=b,a<=b, a<b, a==b , a%b, a**b
2.) a and b ,a or b, not a
3.) a>>2,a<<2
4.) a+=,b+=,a-=,b-=
5.) a/b , a//b


Ques 9:

Integer = int() function is used
example: a=int(input("enter a value"))
Floating point =float() function is used
example : float(121)
output : 121.0
String = str() function is used
example: str=("geet")
		  print(str)
output: 'geet' 

Ques 5:
As an example, spam=10 is an assignment statement 
statement, the value 10 is assign to spam.
 
expression : 
spam=10
spam+=1
print(spam)
   
So, clearly define the difference.
